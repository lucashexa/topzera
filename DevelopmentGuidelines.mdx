# Development Guidelines

<p>
  Here are a few guidelines for the development of the library. Try to keep to this guidelines to ensure maximum readability and ease of use for the components created here.
</p>

## Project Structure

> Listed below is the outline of the project`s folder structure, with nomenclature and explanations for the contents to be inserted on each folder

- assets (every static file needed, e.g. fonts, images, etc)
  - fonts
- components (every component <strong>--please read the topic on Component x Container before creating a component--</strong> should be created here, please avoid using subfolders)
  - any component
- containers (same as above)
  - any container
- shared (all shared non-static files)
  - css
    - variables (please use CSS variables, not SASS variables)
  - hoc (higher order component <a target="__blank" href="https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html">Documentation</a>)


## Components vs Containers

In this project we have both *Components* and *Containers* and the difference can be a little fuzzy if you are not used to the concept, so here are some ground rules:

### You should use a *Component* if:

- your component does not receive other components as children as a default
- your component is *(or appears to be)* a single element
- you don`t plan to use your component in other components

### You should use a *Container* if:

- your component <strong>will</strong> have other components being passed as children
- your component is not a single element
- you don`t plan to use your component in other components

<strong>Important:</strong> If you plan to use your component in other components you should neither create a *Component* nor a *Container*, please create a *HOC*

## How to create a component

<strong>Important:</strong> component in this case refers to *Containers*, *Components* and *HOC*

Every component should have it`s own folder in the project, as follows

- Example(always uppercase the first letter of each word)
  - Example.tsx
  - Example.scss
  - index.js

### Template component Files

All component files should have the same structure, as follows:

#### index.js

```jsx
import Example from "./Example.tsx"
export default Example;
```

#### Component.tsx

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import style from './Example.scss';

const Example:React.SFC<ExampleProps> = (props) => {
    return (
     //your code here
    );
}

interface ExampleProps {
  prop:type
}

Example.defaultProps = {
  prop:defaultValue
}
export default Example;
```

#### Component.scss

```scss
.ct-{
  &example {
    //your styles here
  }
}
```

<strong>Important:</strong> To use styles on components use React Modules, as example below:

```jsx
const Example:React.SFC<ExampleProps> = (props) => {
    return (
     <div className={style['ct-example']} >styled div</div>
    );
}
```

Avoid using styles inline, try to always add custom classes for your styles, this is the more semantic method, and is recommended.
